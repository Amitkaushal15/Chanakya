# Chanakya - Vulnerability Exploitation and Detection Framework

![Chanakya Logo](link_to_your_logo_image) <!-- Optional: Add a logo image -->

**Chanakya** is a Python-based framework designed for penetration testers and security researchers to detect and exploit common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The tool automates vulnerability scanning, generates custom payloads, and provides a modular design for easy expansion.

## Features

- **Vulnerability Detection:** Detects common web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.).
- **Payload Generation:** Generates custom payloads for exploitation.
- **Modular Design:** Easily add new features or vulnerability types.
- **Automation:** Automates the vulnerability detection and exploitation processes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amitkaushal15/Chanakya.git
   
2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Chanakya
   
3. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate

4. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python script_name.py

### Future Enhancements

- **Reporting:** Add automatic logging and report generation for vulnerabilities.
- **Evasion:** Implement IDS/IPS evasion techniques.
- **Additional Exploits:** Expand to other vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Local File Inclusion (LFI).
